# stack_CVAE
We designed a novel generative model, Stack-CVAE, that combines stack-RNN with CVAE to generate structural expressions in SMILES. Stack-CVAE is based on CVAE, which produces substances similar to, but not the same as, the substances used for training. The model used to generate molecules in the proposed model was the Stacked Conditional Variation AutoEncoder (Stack-CVAE), which acts as an agent in reinforcement learning so that the resulting chemical formulas have the desired chemical properties and show high binding affinity with specific target proteins.
